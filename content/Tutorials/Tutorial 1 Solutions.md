	$p$ : "The program compiles."
	$q$: "The input is valid."
	$r$ : "The output is correct."
	$s$: "The function is efficient."
	$t$ : "The algorithm terminates."

# Question 2: Negating Propositional Formulae \[Graded Participation]

### Part A Solutions:

Draw two truth tables to verify that:

1. $\neg (p \to q)$ is logically equivalent to $p \land \neg q$.
2. $\neg (p \land q)$ is logically equivalent to $\neg p \lor \neg q$.

|   $p$   |   $q$   | $p \to q$ | $\neg (p \to q)$ | $\neg q$ | $p \land \neg q$ |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-------: | :--------------: | :------: | :--------------: |
| $true$  | $true$  |  $true$   |     $false$      | $false$  |     $false$      |
| $true$  | $false$ |  $false$  |      $true$      |  $true$  |      $true$      |
| $false$ | $true$  |  $true$   |     $false$      | $false$  |     $false$      |
| $false$ | $false$ |  $true$   |     $false$      |  $true$  |     $false$      |

Hence, $\neg (p \to q)$ and $p \land \neg q$ are logically equivalent. 

|   $p$   |   $q$   | $p \land q$ | $\neg p$ | $\neg q$ | $\neg (p \land q)$ | $\neg p \lor \neg q$ |
| :-----: | :-----: | :---------: | :------: | :------: | :----------------: | :------------------: |
| $true$  | $true$  |   $true$    | $false$  | $false$  |      $false$       |       $false$        |
| $true$  | $false$ |   $false$   | $false$  |  $true$  |       $true$       |        $true$        |
| $false$ | $true$  |   $false$   |  $true$  | $false$  |       $true$       |        $true$        |
| $false$ | $false$ |   $false$   |  $true$  |  $true$  |       $true$       |        $true$        |

Hence, $\neg (p \land q)$ and $\neg p \lor \neg q$ are logically equivalent. 

## Part B Solutions:

To see how these equivalences may be used, let $p$ be the statement "It is raining" and let $q$ be the statement "It is cold". Match each of the following statements with its logically equivalent; you might rewrite each statement using $p$ and $q$ to assist you.

Statements: 
1. It is not the case that it is raining or cold.
2. It is not raining or it is not cold.
3. It is not raining and it is not cold. 
4. It is not the case that it is both raining and cold.

Rewriting the 4 statements using $p$ and $q$, we get:

1. $\neg (p \lor q)$
2. $\neg p \lor \neg q$
3. $\neg p \land \neg q$
4. $\neg (p \land q)$

Using De Morgan's Laws, **statements 1 and 3 and logically equivalent**, and **statements 2 and 4 are logically equivalent**.

# Question 3 Solutions:

Aiken promises Dueet that if Dueet watches anime with him, then Aiken will treat Dueet to a pizza dinner.

a. How would you write this sentence in propositional logic?

>[!Solution] 
> We let the proposition "Dueet watches anime with Aiken" to be $p$ and "Aiken treats Dueet to a pizza dinner" to be $q$.
> 
> Then we can write this sentence as $p \to q$.


b. Determine whether the promise has been broken in each of the following cases:
1. Dueet watches anime with Aiken, and Aiken treats Dueet to a pizza dinner.
2. Dueet watches anime with Aiken, but Aiken does not treat Dueet to a pizza dinner.
3. Dueet does not watch anime with Aiken, and Aiken treats Dueet to a pizza dinner.
4. Dueet does not watch anime with Aiken, and Aiken does not treat Dueet to a pizza dinner.

>[!Solution] 
> In the examples we have seen truth tables where different truth values of $p$ and $q$ lead to a different truth value of $p\to q$. To make sense of this, we can look at this example.
> 
>Case 1 definitely doesn't break the promise. Dueet watches anime, and Aiken keeps his promise. Case 2 breaks the promise because Dueet does his part and watches anime with Aiken, but Aiken didn't buy pizza like he had promised. Up to now it's all very intuitive.
>
>Case 4 doesn't break the promise either; since Dueet didn't do his part, he gets no pizza. 
>But Case 3 doesn't break the promise either! 
>
>Why is this so? In the notes we said that in an implication, we don't really care about what happens when the antecedent is false. An implication, or Aiken's *promise*, only guarantees what happens when the antecedent is true. If we know $p$ is true, we know that $q$ will follow through. It doesn't promise us anything about what happens when the antecedent $p$ is false!
>
>Another example would be buying things from a store. You could pay for a soda, and get the soda (Case 1). Or don't pay for the soda, and leave (Case 4). Or the owner might give it to you as a free gift, and you didn't pay for the soda (Case 3). The only case that is upsetting is when you pay but you don't get the soda (Case 2).

# Question 4 Solutions:

Let:
- $R=\{A,B,C\}$ be the set of circles,
- $S=\{E,G,H,J\}$ be the set of squares,
- $T=\{D,F,I\}$ be the set of triangles, and
- $U=\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I\}$ be the set containing all the objects.

You are also given the following predicates, which you may use freely in your answers:
- $Above(x,y)$ is true when object $x$ is above object $y$ in the grid.
- $Blue(x)$ is true when object $x$ is blue.
- $Grey(x)$ is true when object $x$ is grey.
- $Orange(x)$ is true when the object $x$ is orange.
- $Circle(x)$ is true when the object $x$ is a circle
- $Square(x)$ is true when $x$ is a square object.
- $Triangle(x)$ is true when $x$ is a triangular object.

Determine whether the following statements are true or false for the picture:
5. $\exists u \in U \ [Orange(u) \land Triangle(u)]$
6. $\forall u \in U \ [Circle(u)\rightarrow Blue(u)]$
7. $\forall s \in S, \exists t \in T \ [Above(t, s)]$
8. $\forall r \in R, \forall s \in S \ [Above(r, s)]$
9. $\exists u \in U, \forall r \in R \ [Above(u, r)]$
10. $\exists r \in R, \exists t \in T \ [Grey(r) \lor \neg Orange(t)]$

![[tarskis-drawn.png|500]]

**Solution:**

1. $\exists u \in U \ [Orange(u) \land Triangle(u)]$
   **True**; let that object $u$ be the orange triangle $F$.

2. $\forall u \in U \ [Circle(u) \to Blue(u)]$
   **False**; consider letting the object $u$ be the orange circle $b$. 
	- The predicate $Circle(b)$ is true.
	- The predicate $Blue(b)$ is false.
	- But, $Circle(b) \rightarrow Blue(b)$ evaluates to false.
	 Since $\forall u \in U \ [Circle(u)\rightarrow Blue(u)]$ is stating that: "For every object $u$, if $u$ is a circle then $u$ is blue", and we have found a circle that is not blue, the statement is false.

3. $\forall s \in S, \exists t \in T \ [Above(t, s)]$
   **True**; no matter which square $s$ is picked, we can always find at least one triangle $t$ such that $t$ lies above $s$ in the grid: consider triangle $d$, it is above all squares.

4. $\forall r \in R, \forall s \in S \ [Above(r, s)]$ 
   **True**; no matter which circle $r$ and which square $s$ are picked from the sets of circles and squares, $r$ will lie above $s$ in the grid, since all the circles lie above all the squares.

5. $\exists u \in U, \forall r \in R \ [Above(u, r)]$
   **False**; no matter which object $u$ is picked, we can always find at least circle $r$ such that $u$ does not lie above $r$, since there is no object that lies above the circle $a$.

6. $\exists r \in R, \exists t \in T \ [Grey(r) \lor \neg Orange(t)]$
   **True**; consider letting the object $r$ be the blue circle $a$ and letting the object $t$ be the grey triangle $d$.
	- The predicate $Grey(a)$ is false.
	- The predicate $Orange(d)$ is false, and so $\neg Orange(d)$ is true.
	- Thus, $Grey(a) \lor \neg Orange(d)$ evaluates to true.

>If there exists NO $x$ in set $D$ such that $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are both true, this means that for ALL $x$ in set $D$, it either does not satisfy $P(x)$, or it doesn't satisfy $Q(x)$. There is just no $x$ that satisfies both at the same time.

>
> NOT every $x$ in set $D$ has some corresponding $y$ in set $E$ such that both $P(x,y)$ and $Q(y)$ are true. This means that there should exist (at least one) $x$ in set $D$ where you CANNOT find any $y$ in set $E$ such that *both* $P(x,y)$ and $Q(y)$ are true. In other words, there exists $x$ in set $D$ where for ALL $y$ in set $E$, $P(x,y)$ and $Q(y)$ are not true at the same time (ie. *at least* one of them is not true), so either $P(x,y)$ is not true, or $Q(y)$ is not true, or both.
> 
> Now we just write this into FOL. There exists $x$ in set $D$ where for all $y$ in set $E$, either $P(x,y)$ is not true, or $Q(y)$ is not true. Thus we write $\exists x \in D, \forall y \in E \ \big[\neg P(x,y) \lor \neg Q(y)\big]$.

>[!Further Explanations] 
>After looking at the statement 3, this one should make more sense. What this statement means is that there exists some $x$ in set $D$ where for all $y$ in set $E$, $P(x,y) \to Q(y)$ is true. To negate this, think of the opposite.
>
>If there exists NO $x$ in set $D$ where for every $y$ in set $E$ satisfies $P(x,y) \to Q(y)$, it means that for every $x$ in set $D$, there has to exist some $y$ in set $E$ that doesn't satisfy $P(x,y) \to Q(y)$, which means that $P(x,y) \to Q(y)$ is false.

# Question 8:
You are tasked with building a load balancer that services $C$ clients, and has to balance them between $S$ servers. All clients will request to be serviced at the same time at the start of the day, and the load balancer must assign each client a server immediately at the start of the day.

Your boss tells you to keep costs down, that each server must service **less than** $\frac{C}{S}$ clients in total. Let $c_i$ be the number of clients that the $i^{th}$ server has to service. e.g., $c_1$ is the number of clients for the first server, $c_2$ is the number of clients for the second server, and so on. Since we have $S$ servers, we have quantities $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_S$.

**Question:** Prove to yourself and your boss that this is impossible.

**Solution:**

Before we begin the proof, let's formalise what the question wants us to prove. We need to show that the following statement is true: 

Given $C \in \mathbb{N}, S \in \mathbb{N}, c_{1} \in \mathbb{N}, c_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}, \dots, c_{S} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(C > 0) \land (\sum_{i=1}^S c_i = C)$, and the set $[S] = \{1, 2, \dots, S\}$ (refer to [[Unit 2#Common Sets for Numbers]] for an explanation of this notation),

$$\neg \bigg(\forall i \in [S] \ \bigg[c_{i} < \frac{C}{S}\bigg]\bigg)$$

Essentially, that it is **impossible** (indicated by the "$\neg$" symbol) for all servers to service fewer than $\frac{C}{S}$ clients. Now that we have a concrete statement down, we can continue proving it:

>[!Solution]
>**Proof:**
>1. Let $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{S} \in \mathbb{N}$, arbitrarily chosen, be such that $\sum_{i=1}^S c_{i} = C$.
>2. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\forall i \in [S] \ \big[c_{i} < \frac{C}{S}\big]$.
>	1. Then, we must have that $c_{1} < \frac{C}{S}$, $c_{2} < \frac{C}{S}$, $\dots$, $c_{S} < \frac{C}{S}$. \[Universal instantiation on line 2.1]
>	2. $\sum_{i=1}^S c_{i} = c_{1} + c_{2} + \dots + c_{S} < \frac{C}{S} + \frac{C}{S} + \dots + \frac{C}{S} = S \cdot \frac{C}{S} = C$. Rewriting this (for presentation's sake), we have $\sum_{i=1}^S c_{i} < C$. \[Basic algebra]
>	3. In particular, $\neg \big(\sum_{i=1}^S c_{i} = C\big)$. \[Basic algebra]
>	4. $\big(\sum_{i=1}^S c_{i} = C\big) \land \neg \big(\sum_{i=1}^S c_{i} = C\big)$. \[Conjunction on lines 1 and 2.3]
>	5. $\bot$. \[Contradiction rule on line 2.4]
>3. $\neg \big(\forall i \in [S] \ \big[c_{i} < \frac{C}{S}\big]\big)$. \[Proof by contradiction rule on line 2.5]
>4. Therefore, $$\forall c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{S} \in \mathbb{N} \ \bigg[\neg \bigg(\forall i \in [S] \ \bigg[c_{i} < \frac{C}{S}\bigg]\bigg)\bigg]$$ \[Universal generalisation on lines 1 and 3]

Thus, such a task is impossible.
