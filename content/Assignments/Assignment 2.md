# Question 1  \[6 marks]

Given sets $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, $B = \{ 2, 4, 6, 8 \}$, $C = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}[x = 2k] \}$.


Write in **set roster notation** the following sets:
1. $A \cap B$
2. $A \setminus (B \setminus C)$
3. $A \cap (B \setminus C)$

# Question 2  \[6 marks]


For the following sets, state whether the equality holds or not. If they are equal stating so suffices. If they are not equal, give an example of sets to justify it.


**Example question:**
For example, given the following: $(A \setminus A) \setminus A \stackrel{?}{=} A \setminus (A \setminus A)$ 

**Example answer:**
This equality does not hold.  Consider $A = \{1\}$, then the LHS is $\emptyset$, and the RHS is $A$. Since $\emptyset \neq A$, the equality does not hold.



1. $(A \cup A) \cap (B \setminus A) \stackrel{?}{=} (B \setminus A)$
2. $\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 4 \} \stackrel{?}{=} \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \leq 2 \}$

# Question 3

Consider the following predicate:

$$
divides(a, b) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{N} [a \cdot k = b]
$$


We will relate two numbers $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$, in the following way:

$$
R = \bigg\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{N} 
\times \mathbb{N} : \exists k \in \mathbb{N} \big[ k \neq 1 \land divides(k, x) \land divides(k, y) \big] \bigg\}
$$

For example: $(15, 10) \in R$, because both $divides(5, 10)$ and $divides(5, 15)$ are true, and $5 \in \mathbb{N}$. Whereas $(2, 3) \notin R$, because no such natural number $k \in \mathbb{N}$ besides $1$ satisfies both $divides(k, 2)$ and $divides(k, 3)$.

## Sub-question 1: \[6 Marks]
Is $R$ reflexive? In other words, is it true that 

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{N} \big[ (x, x) \in R \big]
$$

If it is not true, state that it is false, and give an example value $x$ for which $(x, x) \notin R$. If it is true, prove it.

## Sub-question 2: \[6 Marks]
Is $R$ anti-symmetric? In other words, is it true that 

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{N}, \forall y \in \mathbb{N} \big[ (x, y) \in R \land (y, x) \in R \to x = y \big]
$$
If it is not true, state that it is false, and give an example values $x, y$ for which $(x, y) \in R$ and $(y, x) \in R$, but $x \neq y$. If it is true, prove it.

# Question 4: \[6 Marks]

Prove via mathematical induction that for all $n \geq 1$:

$$
\sum_{r = 1}^n \frac{1}{r(r + 1)} = \frac{n}{n + 1}
$$
