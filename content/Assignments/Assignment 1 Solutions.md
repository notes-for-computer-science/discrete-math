# Question 1 (1 mark):

Is $p \land (p \to q)$ logically equivalent to $p\land q$?

# Question 3 (4 marks): 

Let $A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$ and $B = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$. Determine which of the following quantified statements are true:

1. $\exists b \in B \ [b < 1]$
2. $\exists a \in A, \forall b \in B \ [a > b]$
3. $\forall a \in A \ \big[\neg(\exists b \in B \ [odd(ab)])\big]$
4. $\exists c  \in B, \forall b \in B, \exists a \in A \ [a + b = c]$ 

You do not have to give a formal proof of the statements; you may simply state whether the statements are true or false.

>[!note] Solution
>1. **False**. There is no element of $B$ that are smaller than $1$.
>2. **False**. All the elements of $A$ are smaller than a particular element of $B$, namely $9$.
>3. **True**. Since every element of $A$ is even, its product with any element of $B$ can never be odd.
>4. **True**. Let $c = 9 \in B$. Then, no matter which element $b \in B$ is chosen, there will be an element $a \in A$ such that $a + b = 9$. For example, if $b = 4$, then let $a = 5$.

# Question 4 (3 marks):

Prove the following statement:

>[!Theorem]
>$\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[even\big(n(n+1)\big)\big]$

You may use the following definitions of predicates in your proof:
- $even(x) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [x = 2 \cdot k]$
- $odd(x) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [x = 2 \cdot k + 1]$

You may also use the following lemmas in your proof:

>[!Lemma-1]
>$\forall x \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[even(x) \lor odd(x)\big]$

Hint: Use lemma 1 to say that $n$ is either even or odd. When that happens, try to prove both cases separately.

We recommend doing the proof step by step following the rules laid out in [[Unit 1#Allowable Rules of Deductions/Inferences]] in case you unsure about which steps are and not allowed. If steps are skipped, it is up to the grader's discretion as to whether to penalise or not.

# Question 5 (5 marks):

Let $has\_gap(x, y) \equiv \exists q \in \mathbb{Q} \ [x < q \land q < y]$ be the predicate that essentially says "We can find a rational number strictly in between values $x$ and $y$." 

We want to disprove the following statement:

$$
\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall b \in \mathbb{Z} \ [has\_gap(a, b)]
$$

i.e., we believe that it is false. Your friend has already done part of it. In particular, your friend has already negated the statement:

$$
\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists b \in \mathbb{Z} \ [\neg has\_gap(a, b)]
$$

And also started a proof. Your friend's proof has these steps, and they want you to help them fill in the remaining portions of the proof.

1. $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$
	1. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $has\_gap(1, 1)$.
	2. ...
	3. ...
	4. ...
	5. ...
	6. $\bot$
2.  $\neg has\_gap(1, 1)$ \[Proof by contradiction rule]
3. $\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists b \in \mathbb{Z} \ [\neg has\_gap(1,1)]$ \[Existential generalisation on lines 1 and 2]

Fill in the remaining portion of the proof in the middle. You may need more than 4 lines, that is okay, in which case the $\bot$ line should be shifted accordingly. For example if you used 8 lines in your proof after line 1.1, then $\bot$ should be on on line 1.10.

We recommend doing the proof step by step following the rules laid out in [[Unit 1#Allowable Rules of Deductions/Inferences]] in case you unsure about which steps are and not allowed. If steps are skipped, it is up to the grader's discretion as to whether to penalise or not.

# Bonus Question: (2 marks)

Assume every person either only tell lies (knave) or only speaks the truth (knight). A family of 4 say the following the statements:

Agnes: "Edith and Gru are of the same type."
Edith: "Margo is a knave."
Margo: "Gru is a knight."
Gru: "Agnes is lying!"

We can use predicates to encode these statements mathematically as follows:

1. $Knave(x)$ means $x$ is a knave.
2. $Knight(x)$ means $x$ is a knight.
3. "Every person is either a knight or a knave" can be written as $\forall p \in Person[ Knight(p) \lor Knave(p) ]$
4. "Every person cannot be both a knight and a knave" can be written as $\forall p \in Person[\neg( Knight(p) \land Knave(p))]$

For each character, identify whether they are a knight or knave!

**Solution**:

>[!note] Who's a knight and who's a knave?
>**Knights: Margo, Gru**
>**Knaves: Agnes, Edith**
>---
>**(Informal) Proof**:
>1. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $Knight(\text{Edith})$. 
>2.  $Knave(\text{Margo})$ \[Since $\text{Edith}$ tells the truth]
>3. $Knave(\text{Gru})$ \[Since $\text{Margo}$ tells lies]
>4. $\text{Agnes}$ is not lying. \[Since $\text{Gru}$ tells lies]
>5. $\text{Edith}$ and $\text{Gru}$ are of the same type. \[Since $\text{Agnes}$ tells the truth]
>6. $Knight(\text{Edith}) \land Knave(\text{Gru})$. \[Conjunction on lines 1, 3]
>7. $\bot$. \[Contradiction, based on line 5, 6]
>8. $Knave(\text{Edith})$. \[Proof by contradiction rule on line 7]
>9. $Knight(\text{Margo})$. \[Since $\text{Edith}$ tells lies]
>10. $Knight(\text{Gru})$. \[Since $\text{Margo}$ tells the truth]
>11. $Knave(\text{Agnes})$. \[Since $\text{Gru}$ tells the truth, i.e., $\text{Agnes}$ lies]
