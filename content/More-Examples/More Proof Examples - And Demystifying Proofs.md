# Overview

In this page, we will provide more examples of proofs written using the proof system that we introduced in Unit 1. The goal of this page is to help you to get familiarised with:

1. How the different proof strategies (i.e., direct proof, proof by cases, proof by contradiction, proof by contrapositive) work
2. How to justify each step of a proof

*Nota Bene: As we go along, we will introduce relevant definitions, lemmas and theorems that will be used in the upcoming proofs.*

## Proof Strategy #1: Direct Proof

Proving directly is arguably one of the simplest ways of showing that a statement is true. The overarching concept is to start with a certain set of facts and work your way towards the end result: no fancy propositional logic involved, just a sequence of simple step-by-step deductions.

### Example 1.1

We will refer to the standard definitions of $even(x)$ and $odd(x)$:
- $even(x) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [x = 2 \cdot k]$
- $odd(x) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [x = 2 \cdot k + 1]$

>[!example] Example 1.1
>Prove that $even(4)$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Observe that we have an *existential* statement, i.e., we need to show that such a value of $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ exists that fulfils $4 = 2 \cdot k$. Working backwards, we have $k = 2$, so perhaps we could start there.

>3. $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [3 = 2 \cdot k + 1]$ \[Existential generalisation on lines 1, 2]
>4. $odd(3)$ \[Unpacking definition of $odd$]

### Example 1.2

We will refer to the following definition for rational numbers: 
$$x \in \mathbb{Q} \equiv \exists p \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists q \in \mathbb{Z} \ \bigg[q \neq 0 \land x = \frac{p}{q}\bigg]$$

>[!example] Example 1.2
>Prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ [n \in \mathbb{Q}]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Now, we have a *universal* statement, so we need to prove the statement for every possible integer $n$. Doing so manually is clearly impossible, but we can **instantiate** an arbitrary value $n$ and show that the statement is true for this particular $x$. Finally, we **generalise** it back into a universal statement.

Regarding the statement itself, it is not hard to see why the statement should be true: for every integer $x$, we have $x = \frac{x}{1}$, and $\frac{x}{1}$ is clearly a rational number!

>**Rules of deduction/inference used:**
>- On line 5, we performed a **conjunction** because the definition of $\mathbb{Q}$ required the proposition "$q \neq 0 \land n = \frac{p}{q}$" to appear. To make this explicit, we rewrite lines 3 and 4 into a form that looks *exactly* like it.

>[!faq] Why do I need to mention that $1$ is in $\mathbb{Z}$?
>This is because the *definition* of the rational numbers requires that the numerator and the denominator in our fraction have to be integers themselves ("$\exists p \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists q \in \mathbb{Z}$"). Therefore, to fit the definition explicitly, we should state that $n$ and $1$ are also integers.

### Example 1.3

For this example, we introduce the concept of congruence. 
$$congruent(a,b,n) \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [a-b = k \cdot n]$$
If $congruent(a,b,n)$, we say that "$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$".

>[!example] Example 1.3
>Prove that $\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall b \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ [congruent(a,b,n) \to congruent(b,a,n)]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Once again, there are three universal quantifiers involved, so we might instantiate each one of them. Now, our goal is to show that if $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$, then $b$ is also congruent to $a$ modulo $n$.

Let's try out some examples to get a feel of why this statement would be true. Suppose we pick $25$, $10$ and $5$. Then, $congruent(25,10,5)$ since $25-10=15$, and $15$ is a multiple of $5$. What about $congruent(10,25,5)$? Well, that's also true, because $10-25=-15$, and $-15$ is also a multiple of $5$.

At this point, you might observe that the quantities $a-b$ and $b-a$ are really just the same thing, except that one is positive and the other is negative. In that case, the sign does not affect whether they are multiples of $n$, i.e., if $a-b$ is a multiple of $n$, then $b-a$ must necessarily be a multiple of $n$ as well! And therein lies the insight of the proof.

As for constructing the proof itself, we notice that there is an **implication** in the statement. In such situations, we *assume the antecedent* and try to *prove the consequent*. In other words, if we want to show that $p \to q$, then we assume $p$ and try to prove $q$ by the end.

## Proof Strategy #2: Proof by Cases

Sometimes, a direct proof might not work because different instances might have different properties, so choosing arbitrarily might not be a good idea. In such situations, we can break down the statement into several cases, and prove each case separately. 

There are **two important properties** to take note when proving by cases:
1. You must consider *all possible cases*.
2. In *every single case*, the statement must hold true.

Keep these two properties in mind as you go through the following proofs!

### Example 2.1

For this example, we introduce the definition of absolute values (also known as modulus) for any real number $x$:
$$
|x|= 
\begin{cases}
x, & \text{if } x > 0 \\
0, & \text {if } x = 0 \\
-x & \text {if } x < 0  
\end{cases}
$$

We will also define the following for real numbers $x$ and $y$:
$$x \geq y \iff x > y \lor x = y$$

>[!example] Example 2.1
>Prove that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R} \ [|x| \geq 0]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Given the definition of $|x|$, it is not difficult to see how the proof by cases would work: consider each of the three cases, and show that $|x| \geq 0$. The first two cases are trivial, and the last case is easy to show given some basic knowledge of how inequalities work.

>[!example]+ Proof 2.1
>**Proof:**
>1. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrarily chosen.
>2. Since $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $x > 0 \lor x = 0 \lor x < 0$. \[Basic algebra]

### Example 2.2

For this example, we refer to the lemma presented in Q4 of [[Assignment 1]]:

>[!note] Lemma 1
>$\forall x \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[even(x) \lor odd(x)\big]$.

>[!example] Example 2.2
>Prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[even(3n^2 + n + 14)\big]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Clearly, our proof must involve finding the value of $3n^2 + n + 14$, then showing that it fits the definition of $even$. Direct proof probably will not be useful, since instantiating $n$ just gives us $3n^2 + n + 14$, and we are back to square one. What if we try proving by cases? Which cases do we consider?

For a start, since we need to prove that something is even, we might just begin by trying even values of $n$ and seeing where that brings us. Suppose $n = 6$. Then, $$3n^2+n+14 = 3 \cdot 6^2 + 6 + 14 = \textcolor{green}{108} + \textcolor{green}{6} + 14 = 128$$
Well, that wasn't too surprising, was it? Each term of the sum is clearly even, so their sum must be even as well! Ok, what about odd numbers then? Let's try $n = 5$: $$3n^2 + n + 14 = 3 \cdot 5^2 + 5 + 14 = \textcolor{red}{75} + \textcolor{red}{5} + 14 = 94$$
Interesting! Somehow, even though the first two terms were not even, their sum ended up being even; one might say that their odd-ness "cancelled out". The question becomes: "Will this 'cancelling out' occur for all odd numbers?"

As it turns out, the answer is **yes**, and we can show this algebraically.

### Example 2.3

For this example, we will refer to the following definition of divisibility: $$divides(a,b) \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \ [b = a \cdot k]$$
To aid our proof, we will also introduce the following lemma:

>[!note] Lemma 2
>$\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[congruent(n,0,3) \lor congruent(n,1,3) \lor congruent(n,2,3)\big]$.

>[!example] Example 2.3
>Prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[divides\big(3,n(n-1)(n+1)\big)\big]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

As always, when it doesn't seem obvious how a statement could be true, it is good practice to try out some values to get a sense of how the proof might work.

Suppose we pick $n = 2$. Then, $n(n-1)(n+1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 6$, which is divisible by $3$. How about $n = 6$? Then, $n(n-1)(n+1) = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 210$, which is also divisible by $3$. One last one: $n = 10$. Then, $n(n-1)(n+1) = 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 = 990$, and that is also divisible by $3$. Ok, it seems plausible that the statement is true! Now, let's dig deeper and try to understand why.

- When $n=2$, one might observe that the result was divisible by $3$ thanks to the last number: $3$, which was the "$n+1$" factor of our product.
- When $n = 6$, the product is obviously divisible by $3$ thanks to the "$n$" factor of our product.
- When $n = 10$, the product was divisible by $3$ because of the number $9$, which was due to the "$n-1$" factor of our product.

Hmm, it seems like no matter which number we pick, there will always be a factor (either $n$, $n-1$, or $n+1$) that is divisible by $3$. How strange!

## Proof Strategy #3: Proof by Contradiction

Often, proving directly (be it using direct proof or proving by cases) is infeasible or downright impossible. In such cases, we have two options: proving by contradiction, or proving by contrapositive. However, when there isn't an implication in the statement, it might be difficult to prove by contrapositive; here's where proofs by contradiction can be useful!

Throughout the examples in this section, pay attention to the following:

1. The "conjunction-contradiction-proof by contradiction" trio at the end of each proof
2. How the contradictions were derived without circular reasoning

### Example 3.1

>[!example] Example 3.1
>Prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ [3n \neq 1]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Clearly, the statement is true, since $3n$ must be a multiple of $3$, which $1$ is evidently not. If we proceeded to prove the statement directly as per usual, we quickly run into a problem:

**Attempt**:
1. Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ be arbitrarily chosen.
2. $\dots \ ?$

There is no property about an arbitrary integer $n$ that tells us $3n$ cannot be $1$, as painfully obvious as it might seem! In times like these, we can try a proof by contradiction instead.

The contradiction arises when we suppose that there *is indeed* a number $n$ where $3n = 1$, namely that $n = \frac{1}{3}$ is not possible since we already assumed that $n$ is an integer.

### Example 3.2

For this example, we denote the set of positive rational numbers as $\mathbb{Q^+}$. That is: $$x \in \mathbb{Q^+} \iff x \in \mathbb{Q} \land x > 0$$
>[!example] Example 3.2
>Prove that **there is no smallest positive rational number**, i.e., prove that: $$\forall x \in \mathbb{Q^+}, \exists y \in \mathbb{Q^+}\ [y < x]$$

**How do I know where to start?**

First, we might try to figure out if the statement is even true. What about $x = \frac{1}{2}$? Then we can just let $y = \frac{1}{3}$, for example, and we see that $y < x$ since $\frac{1}{3} < \frac{1}{2}$. What about $x = \frac{4}{7654321}$? Well, we can let $y = \frac{2}{7654321}$ and again find that $y < x$! 

Let's think about this more abstractly. What does a "smallest positive rational number" $x$ that breaks this rule look like? If $x$ were indeed the smallest positive rational number, that means that every other positive rational number is somehow equal to or greater than it. However, as we've seen, that is clearly impossible since we can just halve $x$ to get a smaller rational number!

Therefore, we assume that the original statement is false (i.e., there *is indeed* a smallest positive rational number), and then somehow conjure the aforementioned contradiction.

### Example 3.3

>[!note] Definition of irrational numbers
>A real number $x$ is said to be **irrational** if and only if $x \notin \mathbb{Q}$.

>[!example] Example 3.3
>Prove that the sum of any irrational number and any rational number is itself irrational, i.e., prove that $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}, \forall y \in \mathbb{Q} \ [x + y \notin \mathbb{Q}]$$

Here, the set $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ refers to the set of real irrational numbers.

**How do I know where to start?**

Since irrational numbers do not have an explicit form of construction (unlike the rational numbers, which can be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$ for some integers $p$ and $q$, with $q$ being non-zero), it is difficult to prove this directly. We can no longer instantiate an irrational number based on a quantified statement. Hence, it might be a good idea to try a proof by contradiction instead.

Suppose instead that the sum $s$ of some irrational $x$ and rational $y$ does turn out to be rational; we want to show that leads us to a contradiction. An obvious contradiction we can attempt to show is that $y$ ends up being rational, i.e., we want to express $y$ in a way such that $y$ is some fraction of integers. Clearly, $y = s - x$, and the right-hand side is rational thanks to $s$ and $x$ — hmm, looks promising!

## Proof Strategy #4: Proof by Contrapositive


Finally, we have proofs by contrapositive. This strategy is useful when there is an implication $p \to q$ in the statement we are trying to prove, and proving $q$ from $p$ directly is difficult. Instead, we suppose $\neg p$ and try to show $\neg q$. This gives us $\neg q \to \neg p$, which is [[Unit 1#Contrapositivity|logically equivalent]] to $p \to q$. 

### Example 4.1

>[!example] Example 4.1
>Prove that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R} \ [x^2 \leq 0 \to x = 0]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

If we begin by assuming that $x^2 \leq 0$, we might have to break it up into two cases: $x^2 < 0$ or $x^2 = 0$. In the first case, we would need to say that $x^2$ is always non-negative and *somehow* mention that no real number $x$ falls under that case. This is getting messy.

Instead, if we look at the contrapositive, all we need to do is show that if $x \neq 0$, then $x^2 > 0$, which is simple algebra!

>[!example] Example 4.2
>Prove that $\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[even(mn) \to \big(even(m) \lor even(n)\big)\big]$.

**How do I know where to start?**

Let's try the direct proof: Suppose that $mn = 2 \cdot k$ for some integer $k$, and we need to somehow show that either $m$ is even or $n$ is even. Hmm... looks like we're stuck, because we have no way of "splitting" the product $mn$ into anything meaningful! 

Let's try the contrapositive instead: $$\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \big[\big(odd(m) \land odd(n)\big) \to odd(mn)\big]$$
Ok, this looks much more promising! Now, we have both $odd(m)$ **and** $odd(n)$ to work with, and all we need to do is to show that $mn = 2 \cdot k + 1$ for some integer $k$. This is much simpler to show!
